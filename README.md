# Weader Application

This simpal weather application allows users to search for current weather conditions in any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
It provides real-time data, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and dynamically updates the display based on the weather conditions.

## Features
1. Search for weather by entering the city name.
2. Displays current temperature in Celsius.
3. Provides details about humidity and wind speed.
4. Displays appropriate weather icons based on the condition (Clouds, Clear, Mist, Rain, Drizzle, Snow).
5. Error handling for invalid city names.
6. Simple, responsive UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
